# Sample GitLab Project

During major online events like live broadcasts, security teams need a fast and clear understanding of attack patterns and behaviors to distinguish between normal and malicious traffic flows. The solution outlined here allows filtering flow logs by "Client IP", "URI", "Header name", and "Header value" to analyze these fields and pinpoint values specifically associated with attack traffic versus normal traffic. For example, the dashboard can identify the top header values that are atypical for normal usage. The security team can then create an AWS WAF rule to block requests containing these header values, stopping the attack.
 
This blog demonstrates using AWS Glue crawlers to categorize and structure WAF flow log data and Amazon Athena for querying. Amazon Quicksight is then employed to visualize query results in a dashboard. Once deployed, the dashboard provides traffic visualization similar to the example graphs shown below, empowering security teams with insight into attacks and defense:
